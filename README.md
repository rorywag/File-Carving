File Carving Images

These are images I used in my tutorials found here: https://app.gitbook.com/@rorywag/s/sleuthifer/digital-forensics/file-carving

If you wanted to attempt to carve the files I did in these tutorials then this is a good chance to practice and follow along with the tutorial.

Any questions please direct them to rorywag@gmail.com
